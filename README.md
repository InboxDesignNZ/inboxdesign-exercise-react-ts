![Todo List Wireframe](./src/assets/wireframe.png)


## Backend

  Use the dummy API. [https://dummyjson.com/docs/todos#todos-user](https://dummyjson.com/docs/todos#todos-user)


## Frontend
1. Load the todo list 

   Use user id `1` to load data. `https://dummyjson.com/todos/user/1`

2. Add items.

3. Complete items.

4. Delete items.


## Notes

- All read, delete, update requests will not affect the server data. Use the state management to simulate the results.

- All actions should have clear feedbacks and error handling.

- Use `axios` to handle http requests. Or choose whatever packages you feel comfortable with.

- `Bootstrap@5.3.x` is included in the HTML. Feel free to use any front-end frameworks that you feel comfortable with.

- API data type declarations are defined in `src/types`.

3. Execute `yarn` to install dependencies. Execute `yarn dev` to run the project.
